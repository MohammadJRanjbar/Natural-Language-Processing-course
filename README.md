## Course Description

This NLP course offers a comprehensive curriculum covering various essential topics. Students will learn the basics of text processing, including Regular Expressions and Text Normalization for pattern matching and text preparation. They will explore Morphology to understand word structure, Tokenization for breaking text into meaningful units, and Edit Distance and Spell Correction techniques for identifying and correcting spelling errors.

The course includes practical applications such as Language Modeling with N-Grams, Naive Bayes Classification, and Sentiment Analysis. Students will also delve into Logistic Regression, gaining valuable insights into its applications in NLP.

Further, the course delves into Lexical and Vector Semantics, helping students understand word meaning and relationships. Advanced topics like Neural Nets and Neural Language Models, Sequence Labeling for Parts of Speech and Named Entities, and Deep Learning Architectures for Sequence Processing will equip students with modern NLP techniques.

Word Senses and WordNet will enable students to work with word sense disambiguation, and Encoder-Decoder models, attention, and LSTM will be taught for sequence-to-sequence tasks. Transformers and Contextual Word Embeddings will be covered, along with Transforms and Transfer Learning using models like MBERT, XLMR, GPT, T5, and MT5.

The course will also touch on Statistical Machine Translation and Neural Machine Translation, as well as Constituency Grammars, Parsing, and Dialogue Systems including chatbots. Additionally, Information Extraction (NER, RE), Question Answering, and Logical Representations of Sentence Meaning will be explored, offering a comprehensive understanding of NLP applications and techniques.
